- @title = 'Updates'
The things I am currently working on are:
%ul
  %li making sure all the foil version of cards are created
  %li breaking prices for cards based on #of cards in auction (hypo: you can buy 4x auctions, keep one card, and re-auction 3x and almost break even)
  %li better re-matching system
  %li more metrics!  (historical price in card detail)
  %li design new reports
  %li support for buy-it-now auctions
  %li better card matching system (currently there are ~10k auctions unmatched)

Things that are done (or should be):
%ul
  %li better average prices (rolling month)
  %li Recognizing when a price for an auction is unusally high or low
  %li link up set-name
  %li only including items that actually completed successfully (for example, that tangle wire auction didn't actually have any bidders on it, but it gets included anyway)
  %li finalizing the price of items (currently only lists the current auction price the last time it looked)
