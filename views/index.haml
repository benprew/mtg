  Welcome to the MTG pricing system.  You can search using the search box in the header, or look at the list of cards below.

  The things I am currently working on are:
  %ul
    %li link up set-name
    %li Recognizing when a price for an auction is unusally high or low
    %li making sure all the foil version of cards are created
    %li breaking prices for cards based on #of cards in auction (hypo: you can buy 4x auctions, keep one card, and re-auction 3x and almost break even)
    %li better re-matching system
    %li more metrics!  (historical price in card detail)
    %li better average prices (currently is average for all time...)
    %li better card matching system (currently there are ~10k auctions unmatched)
    %li support for buy-it-now auctions

  Things that are done (or should be):
  %ul
    %li only including items that actually completed successfully (for example, that tangle wire auction didn't actually have any bidders on it, but it gets included anyway)
    %li finalizing the price of items (currently only lists the current auction price the last time it looked)
